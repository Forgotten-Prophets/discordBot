# discordBot

#### Setup Instructions:

1) Install nodeJS on the machine to run the bot, preferably version 6.x.x or higher.

2) Clone the repo.  Once cloned, navigate to the `/discordBot/` folder and run `npm install`.

3) Make sure to define all values defined in keys.js.  This will require accounts with warcraftlogs.com, wowaudit,
and the blizzard development portal to run the bot as-is.
