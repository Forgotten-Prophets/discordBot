# discordBot

#### Setup Instructions:

1) Install nodeJS on your machine.

2) Clone the repo.  Once cloned, navigate to the `discordBot/` folder and run `npm install`.

3) Make sure to define all values defined in keys.js.  This will require accounts with warcraftlogs.com, wowaudit,
and the blizzard development portal to run the bot as-is.

4) The bot can be started in an IDE of your choice or via command line with the syntax `node bot.js` from within the
`discordBot/` directory.
